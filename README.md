# Asteroids Clone (ish) v1.0
For the most part this is just a learning project for me into game development and getting used to the Godot game engine.

## Controls
* WASD/Arrows: Move the ship.
* Space/Left click: Shoot a missile.
* Mouse movement: Point the ship somewhere (I know this isn't like the real asteroids game but I just wanted to try it).

## Features
* Shoot a random floating asteroid to destroy it.
* Your high score is saved in a leaderboard, and you can view/clear it in the options menu.
* Really basic pixel art that I threw together using GIMP.

## Things I learned
Making this game taught me how to apply basic trigonometry to make some cool game features relatively easily (pointing to the mouse, rotating a vector by an angle, etc). I started dabbling into linear algebra a bit too and got into matrix transformations to make the code a little bit cleaner.
