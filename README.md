# Asteroids Clone (ish) v1.0

For the most part this is just a learning project for me into game development and getting used to the Godot game engine.

## Controls
* WASD/Arrows: Move the ship.
* Space/Left click: Shoot a missile.
* Mouse movement: Point the ship somewhere (I know this isn't like the real asteroids game but I just wanted to try it).

## Features
* Shoot a random floating asteroid to destroy it.
* Your high score is saved in a leaderboard, and you can view/clear it in the options menu.
* Really basic pixel art that I threw together using GIMP.

## License
MIT.
